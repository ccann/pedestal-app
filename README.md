# Pedestal App

Pedestal is a web application framework written in Clojure that aims to bring
both the language and its principles (Simplicity, Power and Focus) to client and
server-side development.  This project is client-side specific.


**Please see the [status update](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pedestal-users/jODwmJUIUcg) before continuing**

## Getting started

### Starting a new project

Use [leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) (2.2.0+) to create a new
Pedestal application. This will automatically pull templates from
<http://clojars.org>

```bash
# To create a new client-side application:
lein new pedestal-app the-next-big-thing
```

See [documentation](#documentation) for information on Pedestal concepts and
advice on getting started.

## Digging deeper

### Roadmap

Our primary focus for the near future is Pedestal documentation, sample
applications and improving general ease of use.

### Documentation

* [Pedestal documentation](http://pedestal.io/documentation/): overview of
  Pedestal concepts and advice on getting started.
* API Docs: generate literate-programming-style API docs by following the
  "What about API Documentation?" instructions in the
  [Pedestal Overview](http://pedestal.io/documentation/).

### Supported Platforms

At present Pedestal supports OSX and Linux environments. At this time we do not
support using Pedestal on a Windows environment.

**Some good news**: We will still gladly accept pull requests extending our
Windows support

**The bad news**: We will not invest significant amounts of time into
diagnosing or correcting Windows issues.
